# Instagram-Automation

This project runs a fully automated instagram acount. It automatically generates a quote using pexel's api for image and quotable api for the quotes. It then performances image correction tasks such as gamma correction, pixel ratio correction, and background blur (guassian blur) and puts the quote over it. It checks the brightness of the image by scanning all the pixels in it and then determines whether white coloured text or black coloured text will be better visible. After conducting all these processes it then login's to my Instagram account and upload's the image with the suitbale caption.
